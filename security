In our project goodTeam, we used express framework to build our website with the MVC struture. 
There are some vulnerabilities that would be exposed in our website, and we used strategies to handle them already.
1. Authentication issue.
        The authentication issue is the first thing we handled using passport module. We used two strategies, local and google Oauth2 to secure our website so that
    Only authenticated user can access the information that they are authorized to. The passport module provides the middleware in all requests. In this case, if
    the user is not authenticated yet, then cannot retrieve infomation and would be redirected to the homepage where will ask user to login before they go any further.
    The express session makes the cookie storage encrypted, so that the local session wont be accessable to the user, and they cannot manipulate it to access unauthorized
    content. Also, google Oauth2, as a thirh party login authenticated strategy in our project, is secured by the provider google as well. We use the unique id from the 
    profile JSON returned from google for the google-plus user to identify these users. As a result, the authentication is secured.

2. Authorization issue.
        For the accessed information, only authorized user can have access to the pages that can manipulate the infomation. At first, we would use the authentication
    strategies talked before to ensure the user is logged in. Also, we check whether the current user has the authorization to place the order of such things. If not,
    they would be denied by the controllers. We stored the administrative user for each project seperately in database and we verify them before each modification made.
