# GoodTeam: Looking for parters

## Description
 GoodTeam is a platform to gather students specializing in different fields to work together on some cool ideas. University students always come up with some fantastic ideas in their study, but in many cases they do not have enough knowledge, skills or time to achieve them, even though some of the knowledges are elementary levels. It's not necessary for a student to spend too much time to study all of the required skills, because  someone in the relevant majors maybe have learned it and they also want to do something to practice. If we can gather these students together, it would be wonderful, beacuse everyone can just focus on their major-related knowledge to make a project. In this way, we can not only bring many ideas to real but every member in the group can practice what they learned, gain real professional work experiences, and develop their team work abilities. 

## How it works
 Users introduce themselves in their profile and set up their relevant majors and mastered skills. A sponsor is a student who has a cool idea and want to find someone to work together on it or a student who just want to do a classic project to practice what they learned. A sponsor publishes a description of the project on the platform with requirments of skills. This post will notify all students who have set up the relevant skills in their profiles. Then if someone is interested in the project, he or she can apply for it. The sponsor chooses parters according to the applicant's major,  project experiences and comments from the applicant's ealier parters. When the project finished, group members rate each other and leave some comments.
