# GoodTeam: Looking for partners

## Description
 GoodTeam is a platform to gather students specializing in different fields to work together on some cool ideas. University students always come up with some fantastic ideas in their study, but in many cases they do not have enough knowledge, skills or time to achieve them. Even though some of the knowledges are elementary levels, it's not necessary for a student to spend too much time to study all of the required skills, because  someone in the relevant majors may have learned it and they also want to do something to practice. If we can gather these students together, it would be wonderful, because everyone can just focus on their major-related knowledge to make a project. In this way, we can not only bring many ideas to real but every member in the group can practice what they have learned, gain real professional work experiences, and develop their teamwork abilities. When they are applying for a real job, companies can take their records on GoodTeam as a good reference.

## How it works
 Users introduce themselves in their profile and set up their relevant majors and mastered skills. A initiator can be a student who has a cool idea and want to find someone to work together on it or a student who just want to do a classic project to practice what they have learned. A initiator publishes a description of the project on the platform with requirements of skills. This post will notify all students who have set up the relevant skills in their profiles. Then if someone is interested in the project, he or she can apply for it. The initiator chooses partners according to the applicant's major,  project experiences and comments from the applicant's earlier partners. When the project finished, group members rate each other and leave some comments.

## Challenges for GoodTeam
 Ideas protection might be a challenge for GoodTeam, since someone may not want to publish their ideas on the public platform or someone may steal one's idea to profit. We may allow initiators to just publish a topic or skill requirements, but this would result in losses of applicants.

## Our Project
 Our project is to built a web application to implement the GoodTeam platform. The following is a list of the features:

- **User Authentication**: Verifying a user account. 
- **User Profile**: Each user has a profile including privacy informations, emails, majors, skills, experiences, current projects and rating history.
- **User Interactions**: A user can post a project and becomes a project initiator. Users can read the description and requirement of projects and submit applications to initiators. Initiators can accept any number of applications to form a group.
- **Implicit Social Networking**: Users in a same project are automatically considered as friends. They can check each other's information that only friends have the privilege.
- **Reputation System**: Users can comment a posted project. When a project finished, group members can rate each other and leave comments. Initiators can check applicants' rating level and read their partner comments history.
- **Search and Recommendation System:** Users can search projects by keywords or other users by account name. When Initiators post a project, platform will recommend users having relevant skills and high rates to the initiator.
- **Administrative View**: The project administrative view allows initiators to check the applicant list of a project and add or remove group members.
